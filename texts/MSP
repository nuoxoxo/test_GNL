The working title of the album was Sounds in the Grass,
named after a series of paintings by Jackson Pollock.
Everything Must Go represents a change of style for the band. 
Their previous album, The Holy Bible, had been a stark,
disturbing album with a minimal amount of instrumentation.
Everything Must Go embraces synths and strings with an anthemic rock style, has
a commercial feel thats fits with the Britpop movement prevalent at the time.
Five songs feature Edwards' lyrics â€“ the last time his lyrics
would feature in a Manics album until 2009's Journal for Plague Lovers.
Subjects tackled on the album include:
Kevin Carter, in the song of the same name;
Willem de Kooning in "Interiors";
and the maltreatment of animals in captivity
in "Small Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky"
Part of the rhythm guitar on "No Surface All Feeling" was recorded by Edwards
